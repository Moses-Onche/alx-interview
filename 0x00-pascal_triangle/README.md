# Pascal Triangle

Pascal Triangle is a graphical representation of numbers which are the coefficients of the expansion of any binomial expression. Though it is named after 17th Century French mathematician, Blaise Pascal, it had been known in China since the 11th Century, devised by a mathematician named Jia Xian. It was further studied by another mathematician in the 13th century named Yang Hui, after whom it is named in China.
